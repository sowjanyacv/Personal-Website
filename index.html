    <p>
      Who is Sowjanya? Does she even exist outside of this website? Certainly. I
      assure you that I'm a fully functioning Homosapien (sort of). I'm a Web
      developer whose love for coding started after failing my first computer
      science test in grade 11. Fast-forwarding a bit, I graduated with
      Bachelor's Degree in Information Science and Engineering from New Horizon
      College of Engineering and travelled to Tokyo to work in company called
      Notespace Inc. My main focus these days is honing the skills I already
      possess, creating efficient and clean websites, and enhancing user
      experience and functionality.<br /><br />

        FoodPrint <br />
        <strong>Reactjs, JavaScript, ChakraUI</strong> <br />
        FoodPrint is a web app that scans groceries receipts and detects high
        carbon footprint. The app also sends reminders to avoid food waste,
        tracks users' previous receipts scans, and uses gamification (with
        points and special badges) to increase user engagement. It was created
        by a team of 3 developers and 2 designers for Athena Hackathon (virtual,
        October 2022) on the theme: How can households reduce their carbon
        footprint? I was a developer and produced majority of the frontend code.
